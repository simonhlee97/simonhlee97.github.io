                                Simon grew up in Indiana, so he likes to tell people that he is "a hard-core Hoosier trapped inside a Korean man's body!" His personality and values reflect midwest-America moreso than the immigrant from the Far East. After college he taught English in Korea. He went to grad school and earned a M.ED. and taught high school math in Chicago. He enjoyed teaching, but always wanted to puruse a career in tech. He was coding in his free time, learning how to build custom WordPress themes, and decided he wanted to become a developer full time. So he signed up for the Accelerated Learning bootcamp at Eleven Fifty Academy, and recently graduated (Nov. 2017). He is currently looking for an opportunity to join a team of developers and start hacking away. Outside of coding, he loves tennis, basketball, psychology and business books, photography, and movies. He also likes to write in 3rd person.

                                One of Simon's strengths: Simon has a pretty crazy appetite for learning and coding. He likes to play with the latest libraries, frameworks, and tools, always looking for ways to build better apps. He also follows several blogs related to web development.
                            </p>

                                One of his weaknesses: He doesn't have professional experience yet as a developer; but he loves learning new stuff and new challenges. Anything he needs to learn, he will learn it.
